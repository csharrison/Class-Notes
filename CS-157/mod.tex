\I{Modular Arithmetic} is a system for dealing with restricted ranges of Integers. $x \mod{n}$ is
the remainder when $x$ is divided by $n$. So if 
$$x = qn + r$$
then
$$x \mod{n} = r$$

Two numbers are said to be \I{conguent modulo $n$} if they differ by a multiple of $n$, that is
$$ x \equiv y \mod{n} \iff n \text{ divides } (x - y)$$
